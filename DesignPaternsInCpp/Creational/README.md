  Design patterns are universally relevant

## SOLID design principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

  Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

  Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering
  program correctness

### Interface segregation Principle(ISP)

  Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
